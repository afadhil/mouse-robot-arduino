# mouse-robot-arduino
This project is on purpose to create a mouse robot that will find its way automatically inside the labyrinth and at the end of story will extinguish the fire automatically too. I built it with Arduino UNO for the mainboard, as we known that Arduino UNO has its processor by ATMega so we could write code with C language and upload it through Arduino IDE. In this robot, I'm on using 3 ultrasonic sensors (placed on left, right and front side) that will measure the distance between robot to some solid items. If the sensors indicate the close distance robot will avoid that way then find another. In front-side, I embed fire sensor and its propeller so that will automatically on if indicate fire in front of the robot. The propeller won't be stopped till the fire has extinguished.

I built it when I was still an earlier in college, it was a beautiful moment when me and my friend keep stay awake to finish this project till morning. By the way, I'm the main developer to this project in my team so I have the whole code to build this. If you get attracted to try it you could hit my repository up.
